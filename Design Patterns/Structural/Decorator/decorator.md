# Decorator Design Pattern

- Decorator pattern allows a user to `add new functionality` to an `existing object without altering its structure`.
- This type of design pattern comes under `structural pattern` as this pattern acts as a wrapper to existing class.

- This pattern creates a `decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality` keeping class `methods signature intact.`

## Why Decorator?

- Consider we have a pizza shop. They have one base pizza and you can get 100 different types of toppings in different combination and permutation. How many classes will you make? A lot or unlimited maybe? here comes the decorator pattern.

- Avoids the Class Explosion

- e.g. Coffee Machine , pizza Making system
