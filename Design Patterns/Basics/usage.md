# Usage of Design Pattern

### Design Patterns have two main usages in software development.

## Common platform for developers

- Design patterns provide a standard terminology and are specific to particular scenario.
- For example, a singleton design pattern signifies use of single object so all developers familiar with single design pattern will make use of single object and they can tell each other that program is following a singleton pattern.

## Best Practices

- Design patterns have been evolved over a long period of time and they provide best solutions to certain problems faced during software development.
- Learning these patterns helps unexperienced developers to learn software design in an easy and faster way.
