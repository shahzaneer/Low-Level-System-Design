# Prototype Design Pattern

- Prototype pattern refers to creating duplicate object while keeping performance in mind.

- This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.

- if we are creating some object and while the creation of this object some complex operation (database connection, network connection) is being performed then we can use prototype method to avoid again and again building this object and keeping the performance better.
- pehli baaar complex logic call hoga dusri baar purana object use hoga for complex logic as hum uski copy banayengay

- yeh performance better krta hai (decrease cost)
