# Factory Pattern

- Problem:
- many times we know that we will be using some particular objects with well defined properties
- Solution:
  here we will make a function that helps us in making such objects (other languages)
- Dart provides the factory pattern in built
- "jb koi makhsoos condition di jaati hai uski basis
  per koi object create kia jaye"
- Factory pattern is one of the most used design patterns.
- This type of design pattern comes under `creational pattern` as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.

In Factory pattern, we `create object without exposing the creation logic to the client` and `refer to newly created object using a common interface.`
