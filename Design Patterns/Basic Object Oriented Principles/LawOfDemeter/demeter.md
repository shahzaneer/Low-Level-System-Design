### 🔍 What is the Law of Demeter?

First introduced in 1987 at Northeastern University during work on the **Demeter Project** (which focused on adaptive object-oriented software), the principle originally applied to object-oriented languages, but its wisdom applies broadly.

Its rule of thumb?

> **Each unit (like a method or function) should only talk to its immediate friends, not strangers.**

So instead of:

```python
user.get_profile().get_address().get_city()
```

You’d do:

```python
user.get_city()
```

Because your method is **talking to `user`**, its friend, not `user.profile.address` — which is more like the friend-of-a-friend's-cousin you shouldn’t be texting at 2 AM.

### 🎯 What is "Depth" Here?

That `.get_profile().get_address().get_city()` chain is a perfect example of **object traversal depth**. You're reaching deep into nested objects — and the deeper you go, the more brittle your code becomes. This depth couples your code to internal structure that can change any time.

---

### ✅ Benefits of Following Law of Demeter

* **Loose Coupling**: Your code doesn't depend on internal details of other classes.
* **More Resilient**: Fewer things break when internals change.
* **Easier Testing**: You can mock objects at the boundary without diving into deep chains.
* **Improved Readability**: Clearer, more intention-revealing code.

### ⚖️ Any Tradeoffs?

Yes — **sometimes** following this principle can lead to:

1. **An explosion of delegation methods** like `get_city()` in your `User` class just to avoid calling down a chain.
2. **Slight duplication** of logic at higher levels.
3. **Over-encapsulation**, where the object hides too much and you lose transparency.

But in practice? These tradeoffs are often worth it. Cleaner boundaries, safer code.

### 🧠 TL;DR

The Law of Demeter helps you **avoid writing code that relies on internal object structure**. It gives you **robustness, clarity, and low coupling**. While it can sometimes require a bit of upfront work, the long-term payoff in maintainability is massive — especially in large backend systems or infrastructure codebases where small changes ripple far.
