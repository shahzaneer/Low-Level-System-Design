## YAGNI Principle (Avoidance of Over-Engineering)

### YAGNI stands for You Ain’t Gonna Need It.

- It’s a principle from software development methodology of `Extreme Programming (XP)`.

- This principle says that you should not create features that it’s not really necessary.

## Difference between YAGNI and KISS

- This principle it’s similar to the KISS principle, once that both of them `aim for a simpler solution`.
- The difference between them it’s that YAGNI focus on removing `unnecessary functionality and logic`, and KISS focus on the `complexity`.

- Jo cheez chahiay srff wohi karo over engineering na kro, new feature tb bnao jb zarurat ho bila wajeh cheez nhi banao

### Beware YAGNI is not a justification for neglecting the health of your code base.
