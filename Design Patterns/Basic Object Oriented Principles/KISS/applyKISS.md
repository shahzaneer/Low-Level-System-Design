# How to apply the KISS principle?

## To apply KISS to design and code, there hundreds of ways but, I want to provide you with some ideas:

### Simplify and explain concepts

- Try to code as simple as possible, unfold your concepts, name things properly and explain with comments where the code itself can't (Most of the time, it can and should!).

### Use descriptive names

- As easy as this sounds, trying to find names that indicate something's true meaning can be very challenging. You may try this by telling someone a name and let them assume what they think that is. Don't be afraid of long variable or function names. As stated earlier, the machine doesn't care and won't use your name anyway.

### Deconstruct problems into smaller ones

- Something that does real magic to the readability of your code is deconstructing the problem and solving just one simple one with each function. Try refactoring your code and solve a single problem at a time, but with a maximum of precision and readability.
