# KISS Principle

## KISS is an acronym for Keep It Simple, Stupid.

- This principle says about to make your code simple. You should avoid unnecessary complexity.
- A simple code it’s easier to maintain and easier to understand.

- You should `eliminate duplicated code`, should `remove unnecessary features`
- `Don’t use unnecessary variables and methods`,
- use names for variables and methods that makes `sense` and matches their `responsibilities`, and always when it’s possible, follow know standards of code development.
- You also should separate the responsibilities of your classes and the responsibilities from the layers of the project.

- Aik cheez simple tareekay se hoskti hai tou usko simple tareekay se karen
- Simple solution is seldom the shortest one.
