# DRY (don't repeat yourself)

- The DRY principle recommends software engineers to do something `once, and only once`.
- every discrete chunk of knowledge should have one, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system

## Goal of DRY

### Remove Redundancy (in Process + Logic)

- All the processes and the logic which is similar should be written once only.

### Promote Maintainability

- It will help us to change the code at one place and see the chances at multiple places.
