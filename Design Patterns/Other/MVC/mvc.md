# MVC Design Pattern

- MVC Pattern stands for Model-View-Controller Pattern.
- This pattern is used to `separate application's concerns`

## Model

- Model represents an object carrying data. It can also have logic to update controller if its data changes.

## View

- View represents the visualization of the data that model contains.

## Controller

- Controller `acts on both model and view`.
- It `controls the data flow into model object and updates the view` whenever data changes.
- It keeps view and model separate and thus separation of concerns is achieved.
- On Higher level it is used as the main architecture of code for many applications for scalability.
