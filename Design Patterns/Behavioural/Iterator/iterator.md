# Iterator Design Pattern

- Iterator pattern is very commonly used design pattern.
- This pattern is used to `get a way to access the elements of a collection object in sequential manner` -> `without any need to know its underlying representation`.

## Iterator Advantage over for loop

- Ability to remove elements from Collections.
- Ability to move forward and backward using `next()` and `previous()`.
- Ability to check if there more elements or not by using `hasNext()`.
- Thus you have more control in Interator
- The abstraction of how data is accessed(iterated)
