# Mediator Design Pattern

- Mediator pattern is used to `reduce communication complexity between multiple objects or classes.`
- This pattern provides a `mediator class` which normally handles all the communications between different classes and `supports easy maintenance of the code by loose coupling.`
- Mediator pattern falls under `behavioral pattern` category.

## Mediator Vs Facade

#### Facade Pattern:

- Provides a `simplified interface to access a complex subsystem`, hiding its complexities.
- Structural approach

#### Mediator Pattern:

- Centralizes communication between components through a mediator,
  reducing `direct dependencies` and `promoting indirect communication.`
- Behavioural approach
