# Memento Design Pattern

- Memento pattern is used to `restore state of an object to a previous state.`
- Memento pattern falls under `behavioral pattern` category.

## How to Implement?

- Memento pattern uses three actor classes. Memento contains state of an object to be restored. Originator creates and stores states in Memento objects and Caretaker object is responsible to restore object state from Memento. We have created classes Memento, Originator and CareTaker.
