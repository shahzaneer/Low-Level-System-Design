# Strategy Design Pattern

- In Strategy pattern, a class behavior or its algorithm can be changed at run time.
- This type of design pattern comes under `behavior pattern`.
- Strategy pattern is used when we have `multiple algorithm for a specific task and client decides the actual implementation to be used at runtime.`
- strategy pattern is also known as `Policy Pattern`. We `define multiple algorithms and let client application pass the algorithm to be used as a parameter.`
